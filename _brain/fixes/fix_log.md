## Log

| ID | Title | Category | Root Cause (1 line) | Detail File | Date | Status |
|----|-------|----------|----------------------|-------------|------|--------|
| F001 | Global navbar (T016) caused blank white page on all 4 front-end pages | WEB | Navbar was JS-inserted as the very first child of `<body>` in normal document flow (`insertBefore(el, body.firstChild)`) with a `float:left; width:100%` rule inherited from SupportCandy's own CSS — interacting badly with the page's own layout (Elementor canvas / theme block layout) and collapsing the rest of the page content. Not exhaustively root-caused; fixed by removing the risk class entirely rather than chasing the exact interaction. | inline | 2026-07-15 | FIXED |

## Usage Rule

- Skim the table only. Open a detail file ONLY if its title matches the current problem.
- If no match exists, proceed with normal debugging, then add a new row here before stopping.
- Keep "Root Cause" to one line — that line is what future AI sessions scan for a match.
