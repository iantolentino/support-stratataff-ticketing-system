# _brain INDEX

> Lookup table. Find what you need here — do not open `_brain/` folders speculatively.
> `claude.md` (or `aibrain.md`) is still the mandatory first read every session; this index is
> the second stop, used to decide which of the remaining files are actually worth opening.

## Read Order by Session Type

| Session type       | Read, in order                                                              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New project         | `claude.md` → `prompts/bootstrap_prompt.md`                                  |
| Resume work         | `claude.md` → `progress/progress.md` → `summaries/current_state.md`          |
| Fix a bug           | `claude.md` → `fixes/fix_log.md` → `summaries/current_state.md`              |
| New machine/dev     | `claude.md` → `guides/new_machine_setup.md`                                  |

Never read more than this for a given session type. If you think you need more, that is a sign
the task is ambiguous — ask, per `interaction/assumptions.md`, rather than reading more files.
